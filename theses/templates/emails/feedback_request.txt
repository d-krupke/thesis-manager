Dear {% for student in thesis.students.all %}{{ student.first_name }}{% if not forloop.last %}{% if forloop.revcounter == 2 %} and {% else %}, {% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %},

Please take a few minutes to enter your progress using our template below. Following these templates does not only help us get a more organized overview of all our students, allowing us to better respond to your needs, but they are also designed to help you reflect on your progress. Your entries will be automatically logged in our system and forwarded to us. We recommend that you also keep your own log of these entries.

The template looks as follows. You can freely edit it and replace or remove questions if you don't find them relevant (unless we explicitly asked you not to). Don't overthink it—just be honest. This will not be graded.
