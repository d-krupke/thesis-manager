SIGNALS.PY - Automatic Actions and Event Handlers
==================================================

This file defines SIGNALS - automatic actions that happen when certain events occur.
Think of signals as "hooks" that run code when something happens in your application.

WHAT BELONGS HERE:
------------------
1. Signal receivers (functions decorated with @receiver)
2. Automatic business logic triggered by model changes
3. Side effects that should happen when models are saved/deleted
4. Email notifications
5. Audit logging
6. Cache invalidation

WHAT ARE SIGNALS?
-----------------
Signals are like event listeners. Django emits signals when things happen:
- pre_save: Just BEFORE a model is saved
- post_save: Just AFTER a model is saved
- pre_delete / post_delete: Before/after deletion
- m2m_changed: When ManyToMany relationships change

COMMON SIGNALS:
---------------
- pre_save(sender, instance, **kwargs)
  - Called before saving a model
  - Use to: Validate data, store old values for comparison

- post_save(sender, instance, created, **kwargs)
  - Called after saving a model
  - created: True if new object, False if updating
  - Use to: Send emails, create related objects, update caches

- pre_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs)
  - Called before deleting a model
  - Use to: Create audit logs, prevent deletion

@receiver DECORATOR:
--------------------
@receiver(signal_name, sender=ModelClass)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Do something with instance
    pass

- signal_name: Which signal to listen for (pre_save, post_save, etc.)
- sender: Which model to listen to (only that model triggers this)
- instance: The actual object being saved/deleted

IMPORTANT:
----------
Signals are run synchronously (block the request until done).
For expensive operations, consider:
- Background tasks (Celery)
- Async processing
- fail_silently=True for non-critical operations

WHY USE SIGNALS:
----------------
Good use cases:
- Auto-generating audit logs
- Sending notifications
- Updating denormalized data
- Enforcing business rules

Alternatives to consider:
- Model methods (save(), delete())
- Custom manager methods
- Overriding form.save()

EXAMPLE:
--------
@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:  # Only for new objects
        # Send welcome email
        send_mail(...)

    2. If existing, fetch the old version from database
    3. Store it in instance._original for later comparison

    Why this is needed:
    - Django doesn't automatically provide old values
    - We need them to detect changes in the next signal
